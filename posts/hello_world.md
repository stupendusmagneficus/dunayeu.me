First post about this website, blog and what I'm going to do with them.

Welcome to my website! It's my little piece of Internet. Not very pretty, but I'm not a fan of pretty things. If you want to read more about me check the [About](/about) page.

I intend this site to be a showcase of my web dev skills - it's [source code is available on GitHub][0]. Feel free to take a look at it, I think it's pretty neat. I've used my favorite stack, really - ReactJS and TypeScript. It's a bit rough around the edges and missing a few minor features. I intend to work on the website a bit more and maintain it, maybe even rewrite into the shiny new tech that will come my way in future. I guess the most precious asset would be my blog - and it's written in Markdown, which is pretty widely supported.

I'm still not sure about the blog. I will write mostly about front-end developing. Not necessarily only professional stuff, but also about things I do for fun.
